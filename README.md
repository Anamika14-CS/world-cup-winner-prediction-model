This project is a machine learning–based approach to predict the possible winner of the Cricket World Cup using historical match and team performance data.
I built this project mainly to understand how real-world data can be used to make predictions and how a complete ML workflow looks in practice.

About the Project
Cricket is a game influenced by many factors such as team performance, consistency, past records, and match conditions.
The aim of this project is to analyze past World Cup data and use machine learning to predict which team has a higher chance of winning.
This project helped me connect theory with practical implementation instead of just learning algorithms on paper.

Objective
Analyze historical cricket World Cup data
Understand patterns in team performance
Train a machine learning model
Predict the probable World Cup winner

Features

Technologies Used
Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Tool: Jupyter Notebook

The dataset contains historical World Cup match and team data.
Format: CSV
Includes features related to team performance and outcomes.
The dataset is used only for learning and educational purposes.

What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
How to work with real sports datasets
Importance of data cleaning
How EDA helps understand patterns
How machine learning models make predictions
How to structure an ML project on GitHub

Final Thoughts
This project represents my learning journey in machine learning.
It may not be perfect, but it helped me understand how data-driven predictions actually work.
I plan to keep improving this project as I learn more.
